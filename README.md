Python code to read RSMC Best track data and write it into user-readable format.
It helps to write typhoon or tropical cyclone's date, latitude, longitude, pressure, and wind speed variables in CSV format.
Users using this code primarily download the RSMC Tokyo raw data (link below) into a CSV format. Once you start running this code, you need to provide the cyclone's name (e.g., Hinnamnor) and the CSV file as inputs to this code. Once you provide it, it will generate the CSV file with the variables mentioned above.
