The python code will convert the RSMC Tokyo Best track raw data into a user-readable format. It writes a typhoon or tropical cyclone's date, latitude, longitude, pressure, and wind speed variables in CSV format.
Users who want to use this code primarily download the RSMC Tokyo raw data from the website (link below) into a CSV format and run the code. Users must give the cycloneâ€™s name (e.g. Hinnamnor) and the CSV file as input to get the output file.
